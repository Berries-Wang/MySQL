# Read-Ahead （预读）
&nbsp;&nbsp;A type of I/O request that prefetches a group of pages (an entire extent) into the buffer pool asynchronously, in case these pages are needed soon. The linear read-ahead technique prefetches all the pages of one extent based on access patterns for pages in the preceding extent. The random read-ahead technique prefetches all the pages for an extent once a certain number of pages from the same extent are in the buffer pool. Random read-ahead is not part of MySQL 5.5, but is re-introduced in MySQL 5.6 under the control of the innodb_random_read_ahead configuration option.
