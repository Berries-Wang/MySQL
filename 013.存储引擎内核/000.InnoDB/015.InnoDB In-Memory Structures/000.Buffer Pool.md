# Buffer Pool
&nbsp;&nbsp;The buffer pool is an area in main memory where InnoDB caches table and index data as it is accessed. The buffer pool permits frequently used data to be accessed directly from memory, which speeds up processing. On dedicated servers, up to 80% of physical memory is often assigned to the buffer pool.(缓冲池是主内存中的一个区域，InnoDB在访问表和索引数据时将在这里缓存数据。缓冲池允许频繁使用的数据直接从内存中访问，这加快了处理速度。在专用服务器上，高达80%的物理内存通常分配给缓冲池。)

&nbsp;&nbsp;For efficiency of high-volume read operations, the buffer pool is divided into pages that can potentially hold multiple rows. For efficiency of cache management, the buffer pool is implemented as a linked list of pages; data that is rarely used is aged out of the cache using a variation of the least recently used (LRU) algorithm.(为了提高大容量读操作的效率，缓冲池被划分为可以容纳多行数据的页。为提高缓存管理的效率，缓冲池实现为页的链表。很少使用的数据使用最近最少使用(least recently used, LRU)算法的变体从缓存中老化。)

&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing how to take advantage<sup>有利条件，优势；优点；利益；（局末平分后）占先，优势分</sup> of the buffer pool to keep frequently accessed data in memory is an important aspect of MySQL tuning.(了解如何利用缓冲池将频繁访问的数据保存在内存中是MySQL调优的一个重要方面。)

## Buffer Pool LRU Algorithm
&nbsp;&nbsp;The buffer pool is managed as a list using a variation of the LRU algorithm. When room is needed to add a new page to the buffer pool, the least recently used page is evicted and a new page is added to the middle of the list. This midpoint insertion strategy treats the list as two sublists:(缓冲池使用LRU算法的一种变体作为一个链表来管理。在需要空间向缓冲池添加新页时，会将最近最少使用的页清除，并将新页添加到列表的中间。这种中点插入策略将列表视为两个子列表:)
- At the head, a sublist of new (“young”) pages that were accessed recently(在头部，是最近访问过的新(“年轻”)页的子列表)
- At the tail, a sublist of old pages that were accessed less recently(尾部是最近访问次数较少的旧页的子链表)

>> evicted: 驱逐

&nbsp;&nbsp;The algorithm keeps frequently used pages in the new sublist. The old sublist contains less frequently used pages; these pages are candidates for eviction.(该算法将经常使用的页保存在新的子链表中。旧的子列表包含不常用的页。这些页面是被驱逐的候选者。)

&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, the algorithm operates as follows:
- 3/8 of the buffer pool is devoted to the old sublist.(缓冲池的3/8用于旧的子列表。)
- The midpoint of the list is the boundary where the tail of the new sublist meets the head of the old sublist.(列表的midpoint是新子列表的尾部与旧子列表的头部的边界。)
- When InnoDB reads a page into the buffer pool, it initially inserts it at the midpoint (the head of the old sublist). A page can be read because it is required for a user-initiated operation such as an SQL query, or as part of a read-ahead operation performed automatically by InnoDB.(当InnoDB读入一个页到缓冲池时，它首先将它插入到midpoint位置(旧子列表的头部)。页面可以被读取，因为它是用户发起操作(如SQL查询)所必需的，或者是由InnoDB自动执行的预读操作的一部分。)
  > 为什么新数据是放在midpoint,而不是 New Sublist 的Head处?
- Accessing a page in the old sublist makes it “young”, moving it to the head of the new sublist. If the page was read because it was required by a user-initiated operation, the first access occurs immediately and the page is made young. If the page was read due to a read-ahead operation, the first access does not occur immediately and might not occur at all before the page is evicted.(访问旧子列表中的页面会使其“年轻”，将其移动到新子列表的头部。如果读取该页是因为用户发起的操作需要，那么第一次访问将立即发生，该页将被设置为年轻页。如果该页是由于预读操作读取的，第一次访问不会立即发生，在该页被逐出之前可能根本不会发生。)
- As the database operates, pages in the buffer pool that are not accessed “age” by moving toward the tail of the list. Pages in both the new and old sublists age as other pages are made new. Pages in the old sublist also age as pages are inserted at the midpoint. Eventually, a page that remains unused reaches the tail of the old sublist and is evicted.(当数据库运行时，缓冲池中未被访问的页通过向列表的尾部移动来“老化”。新旧子列表中的页都会随着其他页的更新而老化。旧子链表中的页也会老化，因为页是在中间位置插入的。最终，剩余未使用的页到达旧子列表的尾部并被移除。)

&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, pages read by queries are immediately moved into the new sublist, meaning they stay in the buffer pool longer. A table scan, performed for a mysqldump operation or a SELECT statement with no WHERE clause, for example, can bring a large amount of data into the buffer pool and evict an equivalent amount of older data, even if the new data is never used again. Similarly, pages that are loaded by the read-ahead background thread and accessed only once are moved to the head of the new list. These situations can push frequently used pages to the old sublist where they become subject to eviction. For information about optimizing this behavior, see Section 15.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”, and Section 15.8.3.4, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)”.(默认情况下，查询读取的pages会立即移动到new sublist中，这意味着他们在缓冲池中停留的时间更长。例如，为mysqldump操作或没有WHERE子句的SELECT语句执行的表扫描，可以将大量数据带入缓冲池，并驱逐等量的旧数据，即使新数据永远不会再次使用。类似地，由预读后台线程加载且只访问一次的页面将移动到新列表的头部。在这种情况下，经常使用的页可能会被推送到旧的子链表，在那里它们可能会被移除。)

## Buffer Pool Configuration
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can configure the various aspects of the buffer pool to improve performance.(您可以配置缓冲池的各个方面以提高性能。)
- Ideally, you set the size of the buffer pool to as large a value as practical, leaving enough memory for other processes on the server to run without excessive paging. The larger the buffer pool, the more InnoDB acts like an in-memory database, reading data from disk once and then accessing the data from memory during subsequent reads. See Section 15.8.3.1, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Size”.(理想情况下，将缓冲池的大小设置为尽可能大的值，为服务器上的其他进程留下足够的内存，而不会过度分页。缓冲池越大，InnoDB就越像内存中的数据库，一次从磁盘读取数据，然后在后续读取时从内存中访问数据。)
- On 64-bit systems with sufficient memory, you can split the buffer pool into multiple parts to minimize contention for memory structures among concurrent operations. For details, see Section 15.8.3.2, “Configuring Multiple Buffer Pool Instances”.(在有足够内存的64位系统上，可以将缓冲池划分为多个部分，以减少并发操作之间对内存结构的争用。)
- You can keep frequently accessed data in memory regardless of sudden spikes of activity from operations that would bring large amounts of infrequently accessed data into the buffer pool. For details, see Section 15.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”.(您可以将频繁访问的数据保存在内存中，而不用担心操作会将大量不频繁访问的数据带入缓冲池。)
- You can control how and when to perform read-ahead requests to prefetch pages into the buffer pool asynchronously in anticipation of impending need for them. For details, see Section 15.8.3.4, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)”.(您可以控制如何以及何时执行预读请求，以异步地将页预取到缓冲池中，以应对即将到来的需求。)
- You can control when background flushing occurs and whether or not the rate of flushing is dynamically adjusted based on workload. For details, see Section 15.8.3.5, “Configuring Buffer Pool Flushing”.（您可以控制后台刷新何时发生，以及刷新速率是否根据工作负载动态调整。）
- You can configure how InnoDB preserves the current buffer pool state to avoid a lengthy warmup period after a server restart. For details, see Section 15.8.3.6, “Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State”.（您可以配置InnoDB如何保存当前缓冲池状态，以避免服务器重启后冗长的预热时间。）

#### Notes:
- The youngs/s metric is applicable only to old pages. It is based on the number of page accesses. There can be multiple accesses for a given page, all of which are counted. If you see very low youngs/s values when there are no large scans occurring, consider reducing the delay time or increasing the percentage of the buffer pool used for the old sublist. Increasing the percentage makes the old sublist larger so that it takes longer for pages in that sublist to move to the tail, which increases the likelihood that those pages are accessed again and made young. See Section 15.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”.
